THIS IS THE README!!

wanna run this not yet finished scraper?

in this directory:

npm i nodemon --save
npm install

then all you SHOULD need ta do is

npm run dev

and the server should be up

you can post a handle (ex. {"handle": "dril"}) with postman or whatever ya like
to http://localhost:8060/user_scraper

and if i get these async calls down, youâ€™ll get back that users recent tweet!

that's it for now!

ps. idk i feel like express doesnt install from the package.json so if it doesnt work
npm i express
npm install
